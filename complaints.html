    <h1>DIVAID INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL</h1>
    <h2>COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE</h2>
    <p>Divaid International School is committed to providing a high-quality service to everyone we deal with.  If children/parents/guardians/other individuals have any comments or complaints about our school, we would like to hear from you.</p>
    <p>We will take all complaints seriously and are committed to resolving them in a timely manner. Our objective is to better serve our clients by learning from our mistakes. In the first instance, we hope that complaints can be handled informally without too much disruption to you or your child. This can be done by calling the manager or having an informal conversation after your child’s session.  Please note that in this case it may be necessary to wait till all other children and staffs have been dismissed.</p>
    <p>We aim to informally resolve a complaint as soon as possible but within a maximum of 5 working days.  If your complaint cannot be dealt with informally, we will direct you to our formal complaints procedure below.</p>
    <p>There are certain times when a complaint cannot be handled informally. In these circumstances we direct parents/guardians/other individuals to make a formal complaint in writing.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span>  If your complaint has a safeguarding element then you should refer to our safeguarding policy which will dictate the next course of action.</p>
    <h2>Making a formal complaint</h2>
    <p>If you wish to make a formal complaint we request that you follow steps below:  You can make a formal complaint by:  – E-mail: divaidinternationalschool@yahoo.com – If the nature of your complaint requires it, we will send you a complaints form to complete.</p>
    <p>If you have a difficulty with submitting a complaint in writing, please contact us by phone or in person and we can support you with making the complaint.</p>
    <p>Please include the following information when making a complaint to the Manager/Registered Provider: – Name, address, a daytime telephone number and details of the complaint to include relevant dates and times – Names of those involved (including staff) – Be clear about what you are hoping to achieve (apology, explanation etc.) – Copies of any relevant documentation – State your preferred method of communication.</p>
    <h2>Actions we will take on receiving your complaint</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We will formally acknowledge your complaint within 5 working days.</li>
        <li>The Manager/Registered Provider will assess the complaint and the level of risk posed. If a matter concerns an immediate risk to safety or security, the response will be immediate and will be escalated appropriately.</li>
        <li>The Manager/Registered Provider will confirm that the issue raised in the complaint is within the control of the service.</li>
        <li>If there is more than one issue raised in the complaint, the Registered Provider will determine whether each issue needs to be separately addressed.</li>
        <li>The Manager/Registered Provider will look at addressing the complaint and will let you know if this includes an investigation.</li>
        <li>A full response to the complaint will be issued within 28 working days.</li>
        <li>If there is a delay to the timeline of issuing a response we will notify the person making the complaint as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>The person making the complaint will be kept informed of the progress of the complaint.</li>
        <h2>Investigation</h2>
        <li>All complaints are thoroughly and objectively investigated. The investigation is handled appropriately and sensitively. The person investigating the complaint will aim first to establish the facts related to the case.</li>
        <li>All staff must participate in the investigation of a complaint, as required. Any staff member involved in the complaint will be supported throughout the process.</li>
        <h2>Outcome and Response</h2>
        <li>Following the formal investigation of your complaint, we will let you know what we have found via your preferred form of communication. We will explain how and why we came to our conclusions and outline any changes to policies/procedures, practice and risk management arising from the investigation.</li>
        <li>Where no grounds for the complaint are found, the person making the complaint will be notified and information detailing the next stage will be provided. We will share any recommendations from our investigation with the complainant and also all relevant staff.</li>
        <li>We will outline the appeals process as part of the complaint response.  If the complainant is dissatisfied with the response to the complaint, then there is the opportunity to appeal it. The appeal must be submitted within 5 working days.</li>
        <li>The appeal will be handled by someone who was not involved in the original complaint process.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We believe that all complainants have the right to be heard, understood and respected. However, we also consider that our staffs have the same rights. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We, therefore, expect you to be polite and courteous</span> in your dealings with us. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We will not tolerate aggressive or abusive behaviour</span>, unreasonable demands or unreasonable persistence.</p>
